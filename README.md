# Imputer-Strategy-Pattern

This project was part of a school assignment to demonstrate proficiency in Object-Oriented Programming concepts, specifically the Strategy and Factory design patterns. The task involved designing and implementing a custom version of the class Imputer, similar to the one found in the sklearn.preprocessing module. The Imputer class was designed to handle missing data in a dataset using different imputation strategies: mean, median, and mode.
