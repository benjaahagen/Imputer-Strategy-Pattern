    "### Context and Task\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Most data science projects start by pre-processing a dataset to ensure the data is ready to use for its intended purpose. One of the tasks that a datascientist would typically complete during such a pre-processing phase is to replace missing data values in the dataset using a process known as imputation. A popular toolkit that assist with this task in python is class sklearn.preprocessing.Imputer. \n",
    "A discussion of this class and its properties and methods can be found at http://lijiancheng0614.github.io/scikit-learn/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.Imputer.html . \n",
    "\n",
    "You are required to design and implement your own version of class Imputer. Your version should make use of the **strategy pattern** to ensure it is extensible and easy to maintain. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Specifications\n",
    "#### Initial Parameters\n",
    "Your class Imputer should (initially) accept  should accept two parameters, namely strategy and axis with the following options: \n",
    "\n",
    "**strategy** : string, optional (default=”mean”).\n",
    "The imputation strategy.\n",
    "-\tIf “mean”, then replace missing values using the mean along the axis. \n",
    "-\tIf “median”, then replace missing values using the median along the axis.\n",
    "-\tIf “mode”, then replace missing using the most frequent value along the axis.\n",
    "Important: It should be possible to add an additional strategy without affecting any of the existing strategy implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**axis** : integer, optional (default=0) \n",
    "The axis along which to impute.\n",
    "-\tIf axis=0, then impute along columns.\n",
    "-\tIf axis=1, then impute along rows. (Not to be implemented now)\n",
    "Note: Initially **we will only impute along columns as the axis you DO NOT need to write any code for dealing with the axis = 1**. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methods\n",
    "Your class should support two methods, namely fit and transform with the following behaviours:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### fit : *fit(X)*\n",
    "- fit the imputer on X.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters:\t\n",
    "- X : {array-like, sparse matrix}, shape (n_samples, n_features)\n",
    "- Input data, where n_samples is the number of samples and n_features is the number of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns:\t\n",
    "- self : object\n",
    "- Returns self.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words: Fit receives as input the \"matrix\" of incomplete data, with the \"boundaries\" of the area for which we want to impute (calculate) missing values. (i.e. a single column, or the entire matrix) and returns an object containing only the part we want to do the imputation on. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### transform : *transform(X)*\n",
    "- Impute all missing values in X and returns X with new values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters:\t\n",
    "- X : {array-like, sparse matrix}, shape = [n_samples, n_features]\n",
    "- The input data to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Your imputer should work as follows:\n",
    "Firstly, the user should create an instance of the imputer (see example cpommand below). In this case the parameters indicate that the imputation strategy should calculate the mean of the values in each column and replace missing values with the calculated mean. You may assume missing values will always be indicated by the word ‘nan’. **(Note: The axis = 0 parameter shown in the example here is not a current requirement.It indicates that the imputation should be by columns. Your version should not have this parameter at all). ** \n",
    " \n",
    " ![title](imput1.png)\n",
    "Secondly, the user needs to “fit” the imputation to the dataset. This means the user needs to tell the class which rows and columns must be included in the imputation. The statement below specifies that all rows and columns 1 to 3 should be included. You may simplify the syntax your class expects, but it must be documented clearly.\n",
    " ![title](imput2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the user will invoke the transform method. Transform returns a copy of the input data that has now been imputed.\n",

The previous specification for Part 1 of this task already required the use of a parameter (for example \"strategy = 'mean'\") to determine which strategy the class should be composed with. However, this leaves the code to instantiate with a specific strategy inside your imputer class. Ideally we want to keep the imputer open for extension but closed for modification.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Factory Pattern\n",
    "A factory pattern is a creational pattern. It is used to create objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client and refer to newly created objects using a common interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some advantages are that the factory pattern allows the sub-classes to choose the type of objects to create, and it promotes the loose-coupling by eliminating the need to bind application-specific classes into the code. That means the code interacts solely with the resultant interface or abstract class, so that it will work with any classes that implement that interface or that extend that abstract class.\n",
    "The main disadvantage of the factory pattern is that the classes of the factory are tightly coupled to the classes of the product. That means that any change in the product interface will require a change in the factory interface. The factory pattern requires a lot of subclasses since the factory class is responsible for instantiating all the different objects in the product hierarchy. The factory pattern adds complexity to the code because you need to introduce a lot of new subclasses to implement it. The best scenario to use the factory pattern is when the client doesn’t know what exact class it requires or when the client should be able to choose the type of object to create.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy Pattern\n",
    "A Strategy pattern is a behavioral pattern. It is used to create an interchangeable family of algorithms from which the required process is chosen at run-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some advantages are that the strategy pattern allows you to change the behavior of an object at run-time and that clients must know the existence of different strategies and that clients must understand how the strategies differ.\n",
    "Some disadvantage of the strategy pattern is that it requires a lot of similar classes. For example, if you have 4 strategies, then you need to have 4 concrete classes of the strategy. But the main disadvantage of the strategy pattern is that it makes the code more complicated because you need to introduce a lot of new classes to implement it. The best scenario to use the strategy pattern is when you have a lot of similar classes that only differ in behavior.\n",
